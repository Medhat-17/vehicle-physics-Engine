# ðŸš— Vehicle Physics Simulation (C++ Arduino-Compatible)

A high-fidelity car physics simulator written in C++ for Arduino and desktop environments. Implements vector math, tire friction, air drag, Ackermann steering, and realistic acceleration/braking dynamics â€” all in a compact but powerful simulation engine.

> ðŸ’¡ Inspired by real-world vehicle dynamics research, perfect for robotics, simulation, and embedded systems development.

## âœ¨ Features
- Full physics-based motion (mass, engine force, drag, friction)
- Tire friction and lateral slip simulation
- Ackermann steering geometry
- Reset on collision
- Arduino-compatible for embedded deployment
- Easily portable to desktop visualization (SFML/SDL)

## ðŸš€ Future Plans
- Visual simulator in SFML or Python
- Sensor simulation (LIDAR, GPS)
- AI control (RL, PID)
